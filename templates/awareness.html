    <h2>Real Fraud Case: The Story of Sarah Johnson</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>
            In 2024, Sarah Johnson, a small business owner from New York, received an urgent email that appeared to be from her bank. 
            The email warned her about "suspicious activities" on her account and urged her to verify her credentials immediately through a provided link.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trusting the email, Sarah clicked the link and entered her bank details. Within minutes, unauthorized transactions began draining her account.
            Fortunately, she noticed the alerts quickly and contacted her bank's fraud team, who froze the account just in time — saving her from losing thousands of dollars.
        </p>
        <p class="lesson">
            <strong>Lesson:</strong> Always verify the source before clicking links. Banks never ask for sensitive information via email or SMS.
